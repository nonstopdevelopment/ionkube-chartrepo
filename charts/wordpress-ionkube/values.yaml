wordpress:
  blogName: "My Awesome Blog" # User input from your UI
  adminUser: "user"           # User input or auto-generated
  adminPassword: "changeme"   # MUST be auto-generated and passed securely by your backend

# --- Database Configuration (Handled automatically by the platform) ---
mariadb:
  rootPassword: "changeme-root"   # MUST be auto-generated
  dbPassword: "changeme-db-user"  # MUST be auto-generated

# --- Image Versions (Good practice to make these configurable) ---
images:
  wordpress:
    repository: bitnami/wordpress
    tag: "6.2.2"
  mariadb:
    repository: bitnami/mariadb
    tag: "10.11"
